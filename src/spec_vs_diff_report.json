  "summary": "Core visitor tracking flow, backend-generated timestamps, admin password login (9533), and UI/table display are present. However, the Excel export relies on an external CDN library (conflicting with the 'no external services' constraint for export), and there are unrequested authentication/authorization systems (Internet Identity + access control + URL token secret) added. There is also a likely timestamp type mismatch between backend (Int) and frontend (bigint) that could prevent timestamp display/export from working.",
